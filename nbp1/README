NBP1 Dataset Notes

The dataset clearly shows a linearly decreasing ascent rate producnig a parabolic like trajectory for the balloon. We believe there was a leak in the balloon tether interface which where by hydrogen slowly leaked out of the balloon decreasing lift. 

Each line of the csv file is a packet of telemetry from the balloon.

Magnetic field measurements are made using a LSM303 sensor and are the raw data from the respective registers of the sensor.

Temperature data was added last minute and is thought to not be accurate.
